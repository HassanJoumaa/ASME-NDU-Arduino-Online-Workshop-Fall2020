# ASME-NDU-Arduino-Online-Workshop
* This is part of an Arduino online-workshop that was organized by ASME-NDU (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and given by me. It is intended but not specific to the Senior Mechanical Engineers taking the "MEN401 Course- Introduction to Mechatronics". 
The workshop included explaining the following:
1) Arduino: uses and types.
2) Introducing the Arduino Uno microcontroller.
3) Fundamentals of programming in general and in Arduino in specific.
4) Introducing and working with different electronic components and sensors such as: (Ultrasonic-sensor, 16x2 LCD, Potentiometer, Pushbutton, Servo motor, H-Bridge, DC motor,etc.) 
5) Introducing the Arduino IDE and some general tips.

* A hands-on approach was carried out to explain the concepts taught in this workshop, through explaining the theory and applying it directly through live coding sessions.

_Note that Tinker cad was the tool of choice for this workshop, because of its ability to simulate circuits. But of course, the code is provided in an Arduino IDE here._
 
## Arduino-Workshop-Day1
* This folder contains the 7 projects that were accomplished on Day1. The projects are labeled ***"1" through "7"*** as the order they were worked with. 
* This day starts with beginner level coding projects were programming fundamentals and basic electronic circuits are explained and applied, and it finishes up with more intermediate projects. 
* Each project file contains the ***Arduino .ino code*** along with an ***image of the circuit*** corresponding to that particular project. 
_Note that the published projects are well commented to help clear any vagueness and the_ **"Project Task" is given at the beginning of each arduino .ino file.**_  

## Arduino-Workshop-Day2
* This folder contains the 3 advanced projects that were accomplished on Day2. The projects are labeled ***"1" through "3"*** as the order they were worked with. 
* This day covers advanced projects that require the use of advanced sensors with the **Final Project** serving as a task that will definitely test your skills. 
* Each project file contains the ***Arduino .ino code*** along with an ***image of the circuit*** corresponding to that particular project; also, a ***Component electronic list*** will be provided. 
_Note that the published projects are well commented to help clear any vagueness and the **"Project Task" is given at the beginning of each arduino .ino file.**_
